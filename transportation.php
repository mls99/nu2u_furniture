        <p class="moving_list_paragarph">Nu2u provides delivery and transport services, incuding long distance travel. Delivery Fees are based on transportation costs only; no additional labor charge. Transportation costs include round trip fuel and tolls, and any travel over 5 hours will necessitate a cost for food/beverages.</p>
        <p class="moving_list_paragarph">Nu2u has two vehicles available for delivery: a personal Honda CRV and a business moving truck. The Honda will be for smaller items, and the moving vehicle for larger ones. The moving truck is a converted Chevy 4x4 Silverado pick up truck with a cargo box cap. The full enclosed cargo box is approximately 6x5x8 feet. Images of the truck can be provided upon request.</p>
